To run this project, make sure you have SQL Server / SQL Server Express, the Windows Phone tools and the Azure tools both installed and configured.

Then, follow these steps:

1. Configure SQL Server to run in Mixed Mode (I'm using an sa pasword of Pass@word1 in my sample)

2. Install the AdventureWorksLT2008R2 database from http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/55926

3. Download the ZIP file and open the solution

4. Update the EntityModel class in the Cloud project to use your connection string (might need to hand-edit the web.config to do this).

5. Complie everything

6. Press "F5" to start the Cloud project.

7. Right-click on the Windows Phone project and choose "Debug -> Start New Instance".

You should see the sample pop up. 

The Cloud project exposes the AdventureWorks database as an OData source, so we can easily add a new ServiceReference to that OData endpoint in our Phone project. Using the classes generated there, we call out to the service to retrieve a list of products and bind them to a listbox.

Just a note - there is a bug in Blend where DataServiceCollection<T> does not work with design-time data, so I'm exposing a custom ObservableCollection<T> based on the DataServiceCollection<T> just for design-time data support.
